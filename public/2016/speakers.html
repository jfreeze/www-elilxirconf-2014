      In this course we will build a web application using Elixir and the Phoenix Framework. We will walk through the components of Phoenix in great detail, learning how to structure applications into a pipeline of small functions, each building upon the previous.
      <br><br>
      We'll explore a new functional approach to the traditional Model-View-Controller pattern. You will also learn how to integrate with databases through Ecto. And finally, we will explore channels, the feature that will enable you to build the next generation, highly concurrent, interactive applications.

        Using simulation as a tool to visualize Elixir processes and gain a better understanding of how to build concurrent applications.
      </p>

      <h1 class="training">Description</h1>
      <p class="section">
When I was first learning Elixir, I spent the majority of my time getting my head around how to use processes and the OTP. Depending on which languages you have worked with previously, this can be a pretty different way to build software.
<br><br>
One thing that helped me over the hump was writing simple simulations. I modeled the various actors of each simulation with processes and then experimented with introducing uses of Agent and Task to simplify my designs. I constructed later simulations with OTP supervision trees to help me understand supervision strategies and concepts like how to manage dynamic process creation.
<br><br>
In this training we'll recreate these experiments together to gain a deeper understanding of how to build concurrect applications. I'll steer you away from the dead ends I took and push you towards the most helpful insights that I received from these experiments. You'll come away from this day of fun with a better understanding of processes, OTP-isms like GenServer and Supervisor, and even ways to build up output for a text console or GUI.

      <h1 class="training">Audience</h1>
      <p class="section">
        Elixir beginners and intermediates who want to learn Elixir, and Elixir intermediates who want to learn a more productive testing environment. The course starts at a basic level, but moves very fast.
      </p>

      <h1 class="training">Summary</h1>
      <p class="section">
Learning to code in a language is easier when you have test cases to drive the process. We'll learn basic Elixir from the ground up. You'll be able to code one feature at a time, with a test-driven approach. While you're turning tests from red to green, you'll be learning how to write basic Elixir from the ground up.

We'll cover the basics, concurrency and OTP. Along the way, you'll learn about the new groundbreaking testing framework called TrueStory.
      </p>
      <h1 class="training">Description</h1>
      <p class="section">
Elixir is the functional programming language created by José Valim. TrueStory is the testing framework, years in development, from Bruce Tate and Eric Meadows-Jönsson. This workshop is for you if you are learning Elixir for the first time, or looking for new ways to organize your tests.
<br><br>

In Elixir, we'll cover basic concepts, including:
<br>

<ul>
  <li>Pattern matching</li>
  <li>Functions and modules</li>
  <li>Functional program design</li>
</ul>

Then, we'll get into more advanced concepts, such as

<ul>
  <li>Concurrency</li>
  <li>OTP</li>
</ul>
</p>
    <p class="section">
Along the way, we'll work with testing frameworks to improve test organization, and build a chat room. We'll show how to overcome problems encountered with traditional test frameworks, including Elixir's ExUnit.

        In this talk, we'll walk through the design of a collaborative music composition environment using Elm for a frontend that interacts with a Phoenix-channels based backend.  We'll see how we can use the building blocks that Phoenix provides to allow us to build collaboration and persistence features to an Elm-based frontend and represent the frontend application's data structures and actions nicely in Elixir for persistence and transfer.

How we architected a production API in Elixir and Phoenix to sell food at scale.

      <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Description</h5>
      <p>
"For the past 6 months we’ve been working with a client to build a Phoenix powered API for processing online food orders and delivering them to restaurants. Along the way we’ve built a series of services, written with OTP, that are resilient in the face of unpredictable third party APIs and store outages, able to handle failure in isolation, and scale to the demands of an expanding restaurant chain.
</p>
      <p>
This talk will walk through some of the services outlined above as well as covering:
</p>

      <p>
      <ul>
<li>The overall architecture of the project and the OTP applications it’s composed of.</li>
<li>Thinking outside of the database; using ETS and process state to power our real-time restaurant availability service.</li>
<li>Batched processing without job queues; using plain OTP concepts to build a service that’s designed for failure.</li>
<li>Some gotchas we learned on the way to production."</li>

      <p>
These past few months I've been able to encourage my children to do their chores and not fight about it.  Its been made possible with the help of Elixir and an Umbrella project which combines the use of Phoenix and Nerves (and some prototyping hardware) to build a chore system which rewards each kid with their own internet access after they've done their work for the day.  It also makes it really easy to revoke access when they misbehave.  In this talk I'll take you with me back through the journey, and I'll talk about why it was needed, what I learned, and how the the final outcome has saved my sanity.
