      <h1 class="training">Description</h1>
      <p class="section">
When I was first learning Elixir, I spent the majority of my time getting my head around how to use processes and the OTP. Depending on which languages you have worked with previously, this can be a pretty different way to build software.
<br><br>
One thing that helped me over the hump was writing simple simulations. I modeled the various actors of each simulation with processes and then experimented with introducing uses of Agent and Task to simplify my designs. I constructed later simulations with OTP supervision trees to help me understand supervision strategies and concepts like how to manage dynamic process creation.
<br><br>
In this training we'll recreate these experiments together to gain a deeper understanding of how to build concurrect applications. I'll steer you away from the dead ends I took and push you towards the most helpful insights that I received from these experiments. You'll come away from this day of fun with a better understanding of processes, OTP-isms like GenServer and Supervisor, and even ways to build up output for a text console or GUI.

      <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Description</h5>
      <p>
"For the past 6 months we’ve been working with a client to build a Phoenix powered API for processing online food orders and delivering them to restaurants. Along the way we’ve built a series of services, written with OTP, that are resilient in the face of unpredictable third party APIs and store outages, able to handle failure in isolation, and scale to the demands of an expanding restaurant chain.
</p>
      <p>
This talk will walk through some of the services outlined above as well as covering:
</p>

      <p>
      <ul>
<li>The overall architecture of the project and the OTP applications it’s composed of.</li>
<li>Thinking outside of the database; using ETS and process state to power our real-time restaurant availability service.</li>
<li>Batched processing without job queues; using plain OTP concepts to build a service that’s designed for failure.</li>
<li>Some gotchas we learned on the way to production."</li>

These past few months I've been able to encourage my children to do their chores and not fight about it.  Its been made possible with the help of Elixir and an Umbrella project which combines the use of Phoenix and Nerves (and some prototyping hardware) to build a chore system which rewards each kid with their own internet access after they've done their work for the day.  It also makes it really easy to revoke access when they misbehave.  In this talk I'll take you with me back through the journey, and I'll talk about why it was needed, what I learned, and how the the final outcome has saved my sanity.

      <p>
Working as a software developer and having a degree in electronic engineering I always wanted to do something cool combining software and hardware. This desire took me on exciting journey from idea to building a prototype that would assist someone learning to touch type. In this talk I would like to take you on the journey from idea to final working prototype "learn touch type glove". It is constructed using a custom designed, flexible pressure sensor on under each finger tip. All sensors are plugged into an Arduino, which sends information to the server running Elixir. Elixir does the job of analysing the result coming from sensor and displaying it in the browser. Working on this project has sparked many new ideas which I would also like to share with you. I hope to share enough knowledge to inspired you to start playing with plugging in together hardware and software for your own software projects.

I am working as a Software Engineer in Southampton. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering from Ukraine, and I am passionate about challenges and making learning fun. In my free time I contribute to open source and working on my own software/hardware projects. I like the idea of mixing hardware and software together. That's why my personal projects include integration of Arduino, bunch sensors with visual output to the browser. This allows me to write fun games and enjoy "testing" them. As a social person, I like to build social games, which include "testing" with friends. After sipping a little bit of Elixir(programming language, not actual booze) I started to fell in love with it. That's the explanation to why all my latest projects include Elixir.

pg2: distributed process groups implemented in very little code. You should probably know what it is, how to use it, and how it works.

      <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Description</h5>
      <p>
Erlang's pg2 module provides distributed process groups and is a key technology underlying Phoenix's default PubSub adapter, which powers the Channels API that we know and love. Together, we'll take a guided tour of pg2's capabilities and see how easy it is to add distributed features to your own applications. Along the way, we'll dissect pg2's internals to see how the surprisingly short Erlang implementation can be accomplished in Elixir, while uncovering other primitives that make distributed Erlang so powerful. It's time to learn just how easy it is to tap into everything distributed Elixir has to offer!

He has wandered from community to community, learning languages and programming lore but also tossing the occasional error into the crowd. He very much hopes that unlocking the secrets of Elixir will protect him from the questionable designs choices that spawned him.

      <p>
Metaprogramming doesn't have to be scary. Elixir does it really well. Let me show you...
      </p>
      <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Description</h5>
      <p>
"Programs that write programs are called metaprograms. They occupy the space between your problem and its solution. When used haphazardly the results can be confusing and cryptic. But when used wisely, they simplify that space and make it possible to solve hard problems in elegant ways.
      </p>
      <p>
Elixir embraces metaprogramming. In fact, it's fundamental to the implementation of the language itself.
      </p>
      <p>
This talk will answer questions for you such as:
<ul>
<li>When should I write a macro?</li>
<li>What is quote and unquote and when do I use them?</li>
<li>When and where does this macro code execute?</li>
<li>Macro.prewalk? What does this have to do with macros?</li>
</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
Along with some practical examples.
      </p>
      <p>
What's more astonishing is how approachable (and safe!) Elixir makes this complex subject. With this solid foundation, your code will be writing itself in no time!"

      <p>
Jay has been programming professionally for over 10 years. A few years ago, he fell in love with Ruby and began developing a deep interest in good software design, appropriate levels of testing, and other programming paradigms. For the first time since falling in love with Ruby, he has discovered another language with such charm: Elixir.
      </p>
      <p>
Jay works as a consultant and instructor at Big Nerd Ranch. He works fully remote from (sweet) home in Alabama. Remote is a perfect working situation as it allows him to do what he loves while being close to the people he loves, his beautiful wife and baby son."

      <p>
Anyone interested in physical computing with Elixir.
      </p>
      <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Description</h5>
      <p>
With all of the Python, Node.js and C++ libraries for connecting to sensors, actuators, and other devices, it's easy to dismiss Elixir as a language for physical computing. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Between binary pattern matching, a functional approach to transforming low level data, and natural support for recovering from the hiccups of real world hardware, Elixir is an ideal language. The main parts missing have been low level library support.
      </p>
      <p>
This talk starts with a discussion of the options for connecting to hardware devices, challenges and pitfalls of each technique, and tips for minimizing frustration. It will provide an in depth view of using the nerves_uart library, your laptop, and an inexpensive FTDI cable to interact with sensors, motors, smart phones via Bluetooth LE, and more. Each example will show how Elixir can beautify some really ugly hardware interfaces. Finally, the talk will end with how to remove the tether to your laptop by creating standalone embedded devices with Nerves.

Frank designs embedded software for products in many industries including medical, consumer, telecommunications and defense. Frustrated with repeatedly implementing parts of OTP, he started the Nerves project to make it easier to use Erlang and Elixir in embedded projects. He is an active contributor to open-source. Some of his other projects are Elixir/ALE, nerves_uart, fwup, and erlinit.

      <p>
Elixir and Phoenix developers who want to take advantage of concurrent feature tests.
      </p>
      <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Description</h5>
      <p>
Feature tests are one of the best ways to ensure reliability and consistency for web applications. But, as your test suite grows feature tests can become a performance bottleneck. This leads to developers running their tests less often or only on the continuos integration server. In some cases it means avoiding feature tests altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
Luckily, the release of Ecto 2.0 means that its now possible to run concurrent browser tests. Wallaby is a tool designed to take full advantage of that.
      </p>
      <p>
In this talk we'll look at how to configure a Phoenix application for concurrent testing, give a brief overview of Wallaby, and showcase how we can use data transformation and composition to quickly build a highly concurrent test suite.
