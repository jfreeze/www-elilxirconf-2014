      <h1 class="training">Audience</h1>
      <p class="section">
Intermediate Elixir programmers with basic Phoenix exposure
      </p>

      <h1 class="training">Summary</h1>

Learning everything Phoenix channels have to offer by building a real application
      </p>

      <h1 class="training">Description</h1>
      <p class="section">
Together, we'll go beyond the basics of Phoenix by using Channels to build highly interactive and realtime applications. We'll leverage OTP principles to build robust systems that recover from failure and see everything that Phoenix's realtime layer has to offer by building a real application from start to finish.

        Beginners
      </p>

      <h1 class="training">Description</h1>
      <p class="section">
      In this course we will build a web application using Elixir and the Phoenix Framework. We will walk through the components of Phoenix in great detail, learning how to structure applications into a pipeline of small functions, each building upon the previous.
      <br><br>
      We'll explore a new functional approach to the traditional Model-View-Controller pattern. You will also learn how to integrate with databases through Ecto. And finally, we will explore channels, the feature that will enable you to build the next generation, highly concurrent, interactive applications.

      <span class="title">Learning Elixir through TrueStory</span>
      <h1 class="training">Audience</h1>
      <p class="section">
        Elixir beginners and intermediates who want to learn Elixir, and Elixir intermediates who want to learn a more productive testing environment. The course starts at a basic level, but moves very fast.
      </p>

      <h1 class="training">Summary</h1>
      <p class="section">
Learning to code in a language is easier when you have test cases to drive the process. We'll learn basic Elixir from the ground up. You'll be able to code one feature at a time, with a test-driven approach. While you're turning tests from red to green, you'll be learning how to write basic Elixir from the ground up.

We'll cover the basics, concurrency and OTP. Along the way, you'll learn about the new groundbreaking testing framework called TrueStory.
      </p>
      <h1 class="training">Description</h1>
      <p class="section">
Elixir is the functional programming language created by José Valim. TrueStory is the testing framework, years in development, from Bruce Tate and Eric Meadows-Jönsson. This workshop is for you if you are learning Elixir for the first time, or looking for new ways to organize your tests.
<br><br>

In Elixir, we'll cover basic concepts, including:
<br>

<ul>
  <li>Pattern matching</li>
  <li>Functions and modules</li>
  <li>Functional program design</li>
</ul>

Then, we'll get into more advanced concepts, such as

<ul>
  <li>Concurrency</li>
  <li>OTP</li>
</ul>
</p>
    <p class="section">
Along the way, we'll work with testing frameworks to improve test organization, and build a chat room. We'll show how to overcome problems encountered with traditional test frameworks, including Elixir's ExUnit.
