                    In this course we will build a web application using Elixir and the Phoenix Framework. We will walk through the components of Phoenix in great detail, learning how to structure applications into a pipeline of small functions, each building upon the previous.
                    <br><br>
                    We'll explore a new functional approach to the traditional Model-View-Controller pattern. You will also learn how to integrate with databases through Ecto. And finally, we will explore channels, the feature that will enable you to build the next generation, highly concurrent, interactive applications.

                    When I was first learning Elixir, I spent the majority of my time getting my head around how to use processes and the OTP. Depending on which languages you have worked with previously, this can be a pretty different way to build software.
                    <br><br>
                    One thing that helped me over the hump was writing simple simulations. I modeled the various actors of each simulation with processes and then experimented with introducing uses of Agent and Task to simplify my designs. I constructed later simulations with OTP supervision trees to help me understand supervision strategies and concepts like how to manage dynamic process creation.
                    <br><br>
                    In this training we'll recreate these experiments together to gain a deeper understanding of how to build concurrect applications. I'll steer you away from the dead ends I took and push you towards the most helpful insights that I received from these experiments. You'll come away from this day of fun with a better understanding of processes, OTP-isms like GenServer and Supervisor, and even ways to build up output for a text console or GUI.

                    In this talk, we'll walk through the design of a collaborative music composition environment using Elm for a frontend that interacts with a Phoenix-channels based backend.  We'll see how we can use the building blocks that Phoenix provides to allow us to build collaboration and persistence features to an Elm-based frontend and represent the frontend application's data structures and actions nicely in Elixir for persistence and transfer.

            "For the past 6 months we’ve been working with a client to build a Phoenix powered API for processing online food orders and delivering them to restaurants. Along the way we’ve built a series of services, written with OTP, that are resilient in the face of unpredictable third party APIs and store outages, able to handle failure in isolation, and scale to the demands of an expanding restaurant chain.

            These past few months I've been able to encourage my children to do their chores and not fight about it.  Its been made possible with the help of Elixir and an Umbrella project which combines the use of Phoenix and Nerves (and some prototyping hardware) to build a chore system which rewards each kid with their own internet access after they've done their work for the day.  It also makes it really easy to revoke access when they misbehave.  In this talk I'll take you with me back through the journey, and I'll talk about why it was needed, what I learned, and how the the final outcome has saved my sanity.

            Working as a software developer and having a degree in electronic engineering I always wanted to do something cool combining software and hardware. This desire took me on exciting journey from idea to building a prototype that would assist someone learning to touch type. In this talk I would like to take you on the journey from idea to final working prototype "learn touch type glove". It is constructed using a custom designed, flexible pressure sensor on under each finger tip. All sensors are plugged into an Arduino, which sends information to the server running Elixir. Elixir does the job of analysing the result coming from sensor and displaying it in the browser. Working on this project has sparked many new ideas which I would also like to share with you. I hope to share enough knowledge to inspired you to start playing with plugging in together hardware and software for your own software projects.

            I am working as a Software Engineer in Southampton. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering from Ukraine, and I am passionate about challenges and making learning fun. In my free time I contribute to open source and working on my own software/hardware projects. I like the idea of mixing hardware and software together. That's why my personal projects include integration of Arduino, bunch sensors with visual output to the browser. This allows me to write fun games and enjoy "testing" them. As a social person, I like to build social games, which include "testing" with friends. After sipping a little bit of Elixir(programming language, not actual booze) I started to fell in love with it. That's the explanation to why all my latest projects include Elixir.

            pg2: distributed process groups implemented in very little code. You should probably know what it is, how to use it, and how it works.

            Erlang's pg2 module provides distributed process groups and is a key technology underlying Phoenix's default PubSub adapter, which powers the Channels API that we know and love. Together, we'll take a guided tour of pg2's capabilities and see how easy it is to add distributed features to your own applications. Along the way, we'll dissect pg2's internals to see how the surprisingly short Erlang implementation can be accomplished in Elixir, while uncovering other primitives that make distributed Erlang so powerful. It's time to learn just how easy it is to tap into everything distributed Elixir has to offer!

            "Programs that write programs are called metaprograms. They occupy the space between your problem and its solution. When used haphazardly the results can be confusing and cryptic. But when used wisely, they simplify that space and make it possible to solve hard problems in elegant ways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            Elixir embraces metaprogramming. In fact, it's fundamental to the implementation of the language itself.

            With all of the Python, Node.js and C++ libraries for connecting to sensors, actuators, and other devices, it's easy to dismiss Elixir as a language for physical computing. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Between binary pattern matching, a functional approach to transforming low level data, and natural support for recovering from the hiccups of real world hardware, Elixir is an ideal language. The main parts missing have been low level library support.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            This talk starts with a discussion of the options for connecting to hardware devices, challenges and pitfalls of each technique, and tips for minimizing frustration. It will provide an in depth view of using the nerves_uart library, your laptop, and an inexpensive FTDI cable to interact with sensors, motors, smart phones via Bluetooth LE, and more. Each example will show how Elixir can beautify some really ugly hardware interfaces. Finally, the talk will end with how to remove the tether to your laptop by creating standalone embedded devices with Nerves.

            Feature tests are one of the best ways to ensure reliability and consistency for web applications. But, as your test suite grows feature tests can become a performance bottleneck. This leads to developers running their tests less often or only on the continuos integration server. In some cases it means avoiding feature tests altogether.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            Luckily, the release of Ecto 2.0 means that its now possible to run concurrent browser tests. Wallaby is a tool designed to take full advantage of that.

            Distributed graph processing systems are an important part of the modern data toolkit. Graph structures are a great way to solve a lot of problems, and distributed systems let us scale our problem size. This talk walks through how some of Elixir's features (including OTP, macros, and functional programming itself) can come together to simplify writing a distributed graph system. The result is Edgelixir; an early, work-in-progress, Pregel-based graph framework.

            One of the many goals that both Elixir & Phoenix share is developer’s productivity.
            There can be two aspects of productivity: short-term and long-term.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            In this talk we’ll explore how using Elixir’s umbrella project feature can help with long-term productivity when working with potentially large codebases. As a example we’ll walk through building an imaginary system: Acme Bank. We will see how we can break up this system into a collection of smaller applications, each of which has a well defined boundary, domain model, set of responsibilities, and can be worked on independently. We’ll compare this approach to microservices-based architecture which is being adopted by many organizations and we’ll see if we can achieve some of the benefits without incurring some of the drawbacks.

            All developers, but especially those who are just thinking about diving into Elixir and Phoenix, or those who've struggled to explain to others just what it is that makes working with them so joyful.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Summary</h5>
                  <p>
            Last year, I made the questionable decision of telling a friend who ran a Ruby conference about an idea I had for a talk. It required a custom application that I honestly had no idea how I'd build, at the time. He convinced me in the final days of the CFP to submit the talk, telling me I could always turn down an acceptance if it happened.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            Just my luck: it happened. Which meant I had to figure out how to build the app. Just because I had been itching to use Elixir in a ""real"" project, I decided to build the backend with Phoenix, and the front end in React, something I'd also been spending some time with, lately, but was far from an expert in. These both turned out to be the best decisions I could have made.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            I spent a lot of time thinking about what made the app such a joy to develop. I'd loved Elixir for a while, but it was more than that. Eventually, I came to realize it was about one key value: honesty (keys/values -- SEE WHAT I DID THERE?). And because this TLDR is now longer than the abstract, I'll stop here. :)
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Description</h5>
                  <p>
            As programmers, we know that the right abstraction unlocks new ways of thinking about the problems we solve. But can they do more? Can an abstraction exemplify our values? What might that look like? How would it feel to use? Do these words I'm typing right now even make any sense?
                  </p>
                  <p>
            I'd like to share a recent experience with Elixir and Phoenix that convinced me, more than ever, of the power a well-chosen abstraction can have to create a truly joyful development experience.

            Electronic invoices are a critical part for trade in Mexico. If invoices are not created and delivered in time, we can generate serious problems such as complete loss of cargo ships, representing millions of Mexican pesos in losses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            We had a legacy system developed in Java from 8 years ago. It had a lot of problems including:
            <ol>
            <li>Big memory footprint (24 GB per server)</li>
            <li>A lot of servers in order to distribute load and isolate errors (15 servers)</li>
            <li>Frequently downtimes</li>
            <li>No proper error handling and messages for troubleshooting</li>
            <li>No statistics (they produced more load in the system)</li>
            </ol>
                  </p>
                  <p>
            We built a new system that resolve all these problems and provide a better foundation for future services.
            This is the backend that will be used in all the retail and online Apple Stores in Mexico. We wrote the backend in Erlang and Elixir, with additional micro-services in Python, C++ and Java for XML validation and PDF generation.

            The talk requires a little bit of experience with Phoenix in order to understand some of the extensions I will show. I would say it could be classified as a "beginner" talk.

            Como see how we measure everything at Xerpa for our Elixir apps using InfluxDB, Grafana and Exometer!

                  <h5 class="nice-subtitle">Description</h5>
                  <p>
            You can't optimize what you don't measure"". Collecting metrics is fundamental
            to any application, and in the {Elixir,Erlang} ecosystem we have already a lot
            of options to do so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            In this talk, I will show we built our metrics dashboard at Xerpa using InfluxDB
            for storage and Grafana for visualization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            I will show how metrics collection can be made simple and non-intrusive in the
            code, and how Elixir's meta-programming superpowers make this both simple and easy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            I will also show what are the benefits of having such setup and how we can
            leverage InfluxDB's powerful query language (and some crazy tricks too) to
            analyze the evolution of our application over time and generate business value
            ultimately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            At the end of this talk, I expect to have convinced you that collecting metrics
            is easy and very valuable to both business and development. I also expect to
            show that you can live without `New Relic` without much hassle.

            Refactoring is an important aspect of writing software, it makes reading and understanding your code easier for the rest of the team. How many times have you read some code, thought ""who wrote this code?!"" only to have `git blame` display you as the author 6 months ago?
                  </p>
                  <p>
            Functional programming makes moving code around very easy, however there is more to refactoring than relocating code. In this talk, we will go over some of the features offered by Elixir, Phoenix and Ecto that can be used to make reading and understanding your code much easier and as a result of this, more maintainable for future you and your team. From getting rid of those nested case statements, to restructuring your entire application.

            WebRTC is a super neat new way to communicate over the web, and paired with phoenix you can do some very cool stuff. In fact it harkens back to the original purpose of Erlang.

            WebRTC brings peer-to-peer communication to the browser in a way that could revolutionize the modern web. Phoenix Channels are great for real-time client server apps, but sometimes parts of your application need lower latency that only P2P can offer. From telephony to video conferencing, P2P communication will drive the next generation of web applications. We'll review WebRTC from the ground up, and what you can expect when using it. Along the way, we'll see code from a real-world application and the lessons learned integrating WebRTC with Phoenix channels.

            Elixir and Phoenix are built on a foundation of concurrency, speed and reliability. Thinking beyond the browser, these features are ideal for the backbone to any successful mobile application. Together we will explore leveraging the powers of Phoenix and WebSockets to get started building realtime mobile applications in Swift. Along with a basic introduction to Apple's (relatively) new language Swift, we will explore how to setup a mobile application to communicate with a Phoenix application in realtime using Phoenix Channels. We will also discuss the impacts of some of the newer Phoenix features, like Presence, and how these can be used to enhance your applications. Attendees will get a brief introduction to the basics of iOS development, explore how to easily connect Phoenix and iOS applications through WebSockets, and discover how to use the power of Elixir and Phoenix to create complex realtime applications and games.

            Starting out as a self-taught designer, learning front end development was a challenging climb – but going from front end to full stack with Elixir and Phoenix was easier than many would expect. Having built a well-tested Phoenix API from the ground up, I'll narrate the adventure of learning to think the ""Elixir Way"", and reflect on lessons learned.

            Heroku was being abused by shadowy, underworld figures, and it was Kevin's job to stop it. Kevin is a security investigator with a thirst for justice, but even he can’t keep up with stream of abusive accounts being created. His best hope: Heroku had been experimenting with Kafka for an event stream that could help automate the response, but there were some security concerns and platform-specific challenges. Would the security team find a way to stop the abusers or would they all be fired? Find out in this exciting thriller with noteworthy appearances by websockets, Redis, and a killer robot named Cameron.

            Test driven development is a core part of our process at Gaslight, and for our first couple of Elixir applications, we struggled adjusting to writing tests in our Phoenix application after years of working with RSpec and Rails. Luckily, we’ve come up with several conventions, tips, and tricks to help developers write simple, easy to understand unit and feature tests. In this talk I’ll describe how we structure tests, test setup, and helper objects to make TDD as painless as possible. Specific topics I’ll cover are:

            Static typing versus dynamic typing is an age-old debate amongst computer scientists and programmers, and the fact that we still argue about it suggests that there is no single right answer for all circumstances. But what if we could have the best of both worlds by combining the safety guarantees of static type systems and the freedom and flexibility of dynamic type systems?
            In this talk, I will present an introduction to an optimistic, gradual type system as implemented by the Dialyzer tool for Erlang and Elixir. I will highlight the differences and trade-offs between static and dynamic typing, and present optimistic, gradual typing as a good compromise.

            GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 to provide a common interface between clients and servers by defining their data capabilities and requirements. In our work at CargoSense, we’ve both found it to be a transformative technology choice for building general purpose APIs to support devices in the field and third-party developers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            Elixir forms the core of our backend infrastructure, so we knew from the beginning that we’d need to build a GraphQL implementation for the language. The Absinthe package, available on Hex, is the product of these efforts. Its goal is full implementation of the specification--in as idiomatic, flexible, and comfortable way possible to Elixir developers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            In this talk, we’ll walk you through how to build a GraphQL API on top of Phoenix and Absinthe from the bottom-up. We’ll give you the background you need to know about GraphQL’s underlying concepts and provide some of the real world, production insights we’ve gained. Finally we’ll look at Phoenix channels with GraphQL subscriptions, demoing how GraphQL’s concepts extend beyond the traditional request response cycle.

                  <p>
            Let's get you levelled up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            In this hands-on, practical talk, you'll learn about some of the foundational principles behind Ecto, and walk through a series of examples, starting from the very simple and ending with the truly gnarly, to help you understand how Ecto works and how to use it more effectively. You'll come away with a better understanding of Ecto, and a cookbook of examples you can refer back to when you need a refresher. Feel free to bring a laptop and code along!

                  <p>
            VoiceLayer is a real-time voice messaging platform developed using the Phoenix Framework. Its media router core service must be resilient to a wide variety of adverse conditions, including software, hardware and even network failures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            According to the CAP theorem, a system can only meet two of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability or Partition Tolerance.
            We will characterize Available and Partition Tolerant (aka AP) systems and describe different implementation approaches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
            One such approach is based on Riak-Core, which is the distributed systems framework that forms the basis of how Riak distributes data and scales.
            Despite Riak-Core being an impressive framework, at VoiceLayer, we took a different route and relied on Phoenix Tracker (a core component of Phoenix Pubsub) to meet our requirements. We will describe this approach details, contrast it to other solutions and discuss its tradeoffs.
