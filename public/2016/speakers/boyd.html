"Elixir for the next 10 years"

<p>
My analysis of the state of software, the trends affecting us, and why I've chosen Elixir & friends as my stack for the next 10 years.

Boyd has been writing and shipping software for a long time. After 15 years on the Xbox team, which included founding and running engineering for Xbox Live, founding and running all of XNA, and running software engineering for the Xbox One Console, he took some much needed time to recharge, reflect, and survey the technical landscape for his new projects. Boyd has landed on  using the Elixir / Phoenix / Nerves stack and is planning big things for the future.
