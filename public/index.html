While at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert Virding also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world.

                <p>Elixir is a concurrency-oriented programming language built atop the Erlang VM. Its syntax is very Ruby-influenced, and it takes some great features from the Python world as well. In this talk, I'll provide a quick introduction to the language. I'll provide just a quick overview of the language syntactically, as well as cover some areas where it differs wildly from Ruby.

              <p>The Elixir pipe is one of the most distinctive features of the new language. Pipes allow the expression of ideas as a series of transformations, which is the essence of functional programming. But sometimes pipes fail, when return values are not uniform, or when policies change. 
            This talk shows how the combination of pipes and macros makes a better and more uniform experience for both API producers and consumers. Be prepared to take a detailed look at macros, how they work, and how they can play a big role in this popular programming feature, the pipe.

            <p>Haskell, Clojure, Scala, Scheme. We all have a laundry list of functional programming languages that we tried to have our functional programming epiphany with, but it just didn't happen. Then along came Elixir. This exciting new programming language ripped the clothing off of functional programming (FP) and showed us that FP isn't some esoteric paradigm reserved only for those with PhDs in Math Wizardry. Elixir showed us that FP is about the transformation of data -- and that it can be fun!

I'll talk about each of the following points from a high level perspective, 
what we do and why and then show the interesting pieces of code that make it work:
                </p>

                <ul>
  <li>Building and shipping releases using hot code loading: The tools we built (from helping us test code change upgrades before we deploy them, to performing the actual deploy), where we (re)use custom code_change functions, what they do, why we need them.</li>
  <li>"Takeovers" where we switch users from game server node A to B in order to do hardware/software (kernel upgrade etc) maintenance without interruptions. What was necessary to support that, how they work.</li>
  <li>Interfacing between Rails and Erlang</li>
  <li>Clients disconnecting and reconnecting (e.g. the user presses F5 while playing)</li>
  <li>Database downtime (hint: we don't just cancel the running games)</li>
  <li>Integrating Elixir into our Erlang codebase, the issues we ran into (not many :) ) and how we worked around them</li>

This talk expects some familiarity with OTP, knowing Erlang the language is not necessary, all code snippets will be translated into equivalent Elixir.

<p>
I'd love to check out and learn Elixir but I don't really have a problem that is big enough or one that Elixir is well suited for." 
</p>

<p>
How many times have you heard this?
</p>

<p>
I have been writing small command line applications using Elixir to solve some of the same kind of problems that I used to use languages like Ruby or Python for in the past and I'm loving it! 
</p>

<p>
Elixir and mix comes with great tools out of the box for writing these kind programs. Also Meta-programming, macros, protocols, pipes and pattern matching can be leveraged to break down problems into small readable and easy digest code.
</p>

<p>
Elixir is a very expressive language that is good at solving all manner of problems in an elegant way. That means even problems where concurrency, high availability and code reloading are not important or of less of a concern. 
</p>

<p>
Yes Elixir is a powerful language but it is also fun and a great way to think about and express problems in a different way.
</p>

<p>
By the end of my talk I hope other people will feel the same way as I do about Elixir and go forth and create programs to solve problems of any size.

                <p>An elevator simulation has been my side project to explore Elixir and OTP specifically. It's been a nice subject because it is familiar enough and rich enough to go beyond the first StateServer OTP introduction, but without going too far. It's inherently concurrent, has familiar expected interactions between processes, and variations to play with. In this talk we'll go through building this elevator simulation step by step, exploring the OTP APIs, and avoiding the pitfalls.

                <p>I've worked professionally in 6 languages, currently in Ruby at LivingSocial, but my free time goes to learning Elixir. The Erlang ecosystem is new and fascinating to me. I wonder why I'd never explored it before. I taught myself to program at age 13, but took a detour into physics during college. I'm a 7th generation Texan currently living in the Dallas area.

                <p>Object-oriented programmers can have a dogmatic approach to language patterns. Whether it is analyzing, debating or criticizing various implementations, the passion for patterns emerges from the need to both communicate intent and categorize code. The patterns do more than define code, they describe it. So, what happens when we lose objects? When state fades away? When paradigms shift far more than a change in languages?
                </p>

                <p>In steps Elixir. With syntax similar to Ruby but firmly grounded in the functional paradigm, it represents an easy transition for Rubyist into functional programming. But what about the beloved patterns? It turns out that understanding how functional languages implement some of the common object-oriented patterns can demystify this new paradigm. Plus learning new functional patterns can provide new solutions to old problems.

             Elixir stopped being a pretty syntax on top of Erlang a long time ago, and has developed into a formidable solution all its own. We will explore how Elixir's willingness to change has enabled developers to leverage powerful tools such as macros, protocols, streams, agents, and much more.

          2) By visiting <a href="http://austinarboretum.place.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html?corp_id=G-ELIX">Hyatt Place Austin Reservations</a>
          </p>
           
          <p>
          If no rooms are available, tweet @jimfreeze to add more rooms to the block. If you have any questions about the reservations process, please let us know.
